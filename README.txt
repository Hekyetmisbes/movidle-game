## Movidle Game
------------------------


------------------------
## Purpose
------------------------

 The computer randomly selects a movie from the "IMDB Top 250" list and compares it to our prediction. If the features of our prediction such as name, genre, year, director, country and star match the one chosen by the computer, it is shown as a green box on the screen and the others are shown as a red box.


------------------------
## How can we play?
------------------------

 When you open the game, you can see a textbox and a button. You choose a movie from the list and write it into the textbox. Then click the button and the computer compares two films. You have five chances to guess the movie. If you can't the game is over and the messagebox shows the chosen film.
